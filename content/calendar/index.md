*Calendar Sharing for Combined IES Calendar*

If you are sharing a calendar to be included in a combined IES Calendar, please be sure the calendar you share only includes public events. You may need to separate your public and internal ministry calendars. This could seem like extra work, but it will also ensure events show properly on a combined IES Calendar.

For a public facing calendar, please be sure you keep in mind that those looking at the calendar don't have insider context so you may need to include some details.
